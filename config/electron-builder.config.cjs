 * signature that comes on the raw Electron binary. That signature says
 * `Identifier=Electron` and `Sealed Resources=none` — it covers the executable
 * Electron shipped, not the application built around it. `codesign --verify`
 * rejects it with "code has no resources but signature indicates they must be
 * present".
 *
 * It runs anyway when launched straight out of a build directory, because
 * Gatekeeper only assesses a bundle carrying `com.apple.quarantine` — which is
 * exactly what a browser download attaches. So the failure appears only after
 * downloading a release: macOS reports "简鹿 已损坏，无法打开" and offers
 * nothing but Move to Trash. An unsigned build is not merely unverified, it is
 * unopenable.
 *
 * An ad-hoc signature is anonymous, so Gatekeeper still refuses the first
 * launch — but with the "unidentified developer" prompt, which right-click →
 * Open clears. Shipping a real Developer ID signature plus notarization is what
 * removes the prompt entirely; that needs credentials this repo does not have.
 *
 * Must run after copyStandaloneNodeModules: signing seals the bundle's
 * contents, so anything added afterwards invalidates it again.
