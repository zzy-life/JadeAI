/**
 * Update checking against this repo's GitHub releases.
 *
 * The app checks for a release containing the right installer, then directs the
 * user to the configured download page. Silent installation is not used,
 * for three reasons — and shipping that half-working would be worse than not
 * shipping it:
 *
 *  1. macOS. Squirrel.Mac verifies that an update's signature matches the
 *     running app's, and an ad-hoc signature has no identity to match. Silent
 *     updates need a Developer ID certificate, which this repo has none of.
 *  2. Web-only releases. One repo, one releases list, and most of its history
 *     (`v0.1.0` … `v0.4.1`) predates the client and carries no installers at
 *     all. electron-updater's GitHub provider takes whatever release is newest
 *     and expects metadata to be there; here it would hand the client a release
 *     with nothing to install. Requiring a matching installer asset is what
 *     avoids that, and a provider cannot express it.
 *  3. No update metadata. electron-builder only emits latest-mac.yml/latest.yml
 *     when a publish provider is configured, and CI runs with --publish never.
 *
 * So this reads the releases list and finds the newest version above the running
 * one that ships an installer for this machine. The UI then sends the user to
 * the configured public download page instead of exposing the release page.
